          Both Mt Olive and The Peoples Church of Flint are members of the American Baptist Churches of the United States of America (ABCUSA). The ABCUSA emerged the same year MTO did, 1907, as the Northern Baptist Convention. It descends from the Triennial Convention (1814) out of which emerged a number of missionary societies including the American Baptist Foreign Mission Society (1814), American Baptist Home Mission Society (1832), American Baptist Publication Society (1841), and the American Baptist Education Society (1888). Slaveholders could not serve as missionaries under the Triennial Convention, prompting the secession of the Southern Baptist Convention churches from the association in 1840 and the emergence of separate Northern and Southern Baptist Conventions. In 1911 the Free Will Baptist Convention merged with the Northern Baptist Convention. The churches that remained after the secession of the Southern Baptist Convention became overtly abolitionist in their work which, in Michigan, was exemplified by Detroit’s Second Baptist’s illegal support for refugees from slavery.

          After 1834 when slavery was abolished throughout the British Empire, refugees from American slavery and legalized racism fled across the Detroit River into Canada. Once safely across the river, they developed small rural agricultural Black settlements in Ontario. After the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 when it became legal for slavers to send slave catchers into the Northern states, thousands of the self-emancipated fled across the Detroit River into Ontario and joined the settlements there. By the time slavery was abolished in the US, as many as 50,000 Black people were living between Windsor and Toronto. Most of Mt Olive's earliest leaders and members were among them.

          Church-building seems to have been synonymous with community-building in the settlements. Residents and missionaries developed AME and Baptist churches and Sunday schools in even the smallest settlements, often building them from hewn logs. They welcomed newcomers and supported the spiritual, material, and educational needs of residents. Those settlements and their churches were central to developing a strong sense of free Black identity and culture. They nurtured and educated a generation of leaders who would return to Michigan after the War for Black Freedom and take up the work of Black community-building throughout southern Michigan. Baptist men and women from settlements in Amherstburg, Dresden, Chatham, Gosfield, and Collingwood developed Baptist churches in Grand Rapids, Kalamazoo, Lansing, Flint, Ypsilanti, Jackson, Adrian, and Ann Arbor. Mt Olive was started by the children of self-emancipated slaves who had taken refuge across the river and built communities there. Many of Mt Olive’s early members came across into Michigan as young adults and built the Southside Black neighborhood while Billy Durant was still making horse-drawn carriages.

          The spirit-filled people who began Mt Olive lived and died here and are buried in our surrounding cemeteries. Their descendants continued their work here and in American cities across the urban north. Some of those early members include:

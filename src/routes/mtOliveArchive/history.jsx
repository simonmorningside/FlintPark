        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Mt. Olive was the first African-American Baptist church in Flint. In the opening years of the 20th century, co-founders Sarah F. Howard and Rev. William Isaac Lyons invited members of Flint’s early African-American community to a series of meetings at Howard’s home to discuss the establishment of a Baptist church. Those meetings were often announced in the Flint Journal, and in 1907 the Journal announced the emergence of a “colored Baptist mission” on the Southside.
        </p><p>
          Mt. Olive’s founders were emigrants from Ontario, Canada, the adult children of people who had self-emancipated and fled the United States. Both Howard and Lyons had been educated in churches and schools organized by their parents’ generation in the Black settlements across the Detroit River. Both returned to the United States as young adults following 1863, and both were in mid-life and had suffered the loss of parents, spouses, and children by the time they began organizing the meetings. They were assisted by Rev. Robert Gillard, the State Missionary of the Michigan Baptist Convention, and Rev. Clarence E. Lapp, the recently arrived minister of the First Baptist Church of Flint (later known as Woodside and now the People’s Church).
        </p><p>
          The spirit-filled people who began Mt. Olive lived and died here and are buried in our surrounding cemeteries. Their parents had built the first free African-American communities and their descendants have continued their community-building work here and in American cities across the urban north. Some of their stories are told here.

        <h2>The Birth of the Southside</h2>
        <p>
          The overall population of Flint was just under 40,000 when Mt. Olive was founded, of which the Black community comprised less than 500. The Southside neighborhood was emerging as a center of Black life in the growing city. The Indianapolis Freeman, a prominent Black newspaper with a national readership, described the neighborhood in 1908 as “near Thread Lake Park, and intersected by a finely equipped electric railway and numerous and shady streets” in which lived “a community of upwards of 400 of Flint’s colored citizens. Owning their own homes nearly to a man.” The residents of the Southside are noted for their “industriousness and sobriety” and as being “progressive mechanics, who have contributed to the construction of many of the homes and factories of Flint.” The homes of the Southside are described as “well-built” and situated in “clean, well-kept surroundings.” Prospective residents might imagine themselves enjoying a church society, a burial association, and a pleasant life in a beautiful city.

        <h2>The Origins of Mt. Olive</h2>
        <p>
          Both Mt. Olive and The People’s Church of Flint are members of the American Baptist Churches of the United States of America (ABCUSA). The ABCUSA emerged the same year as Mt. Olive did, 1907, as the Northern Baptist Convention. The NBC descends from the Triennial Convention, organized in 1814 to advance missionary work at home and abroad. Slaveholders could not serve as missionaries under the Triennial Convention, prompting the secession of the Southern Baptist Convention churches in 1845. The churches that remained after the secession of the Southern Baptist Convention became overtly abolitionist in their work which, in Michigan, was exemplified by Detroit’s Second Baptist Church’s illegal support for refugees from slavery.

      <p>
          After 1834, when slavery was abolished throughout the British Empire, refugees from American slavery and legalized racism fled across the Detroit River into Canada, many on the “Underground Railroad,” many supported by members of Triennial Convention Baptist churches. Once safely across the river, refugees joined or created small rural agricultural Black settlements in Ontario. Some of those settlements were just across the river in places such as Windsor, Amherstbrug, Sandwich, Colchester, New Canaan, Gosfield, and Mt. Pleasant. Otters were slightly further in at Puce, Buxton, Chatham, Shrewsbury, Dresden, and London. These were not the first Black settlers in Ontario; land grants had been given to Black soldiers who fought for the British in the American Revolutionary War. Some Black settlements had been in place for decades. After the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 when it became legal for slavers to send slave catchers into the Northern states to kidnap self-emancipated people, thousands in the North fled across the Detroit River and joined those Ontario settlements. By the time slavery was abolished in the US, as many as 50,000 Black people were living between Windsor and Toronto. Most of Mt. Olive's founders, earliest leaders, and members were among them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Church-building seems to have been synonymous with community-building in the settlements. Residents and missionaries developed AME and Baptist churches and Sunday schools in even the smallest settlements. The history of the Amherstburg Regular Missionary Baptist Association describes the emergence of those churches:
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>
        “Wherever two or three families settled, they assembled themselves together to give praise to their God, who had delivered them from the bonds of slavery, and to beseech Him to grant that all of their people might yet be freed…small groups met for worship on the Sabbath in homes or in schools…In many such groups the men would band themselves together and hew logs from the forest to make for their group a house of worship.” (2)
          </em>
          </p>
        <p>

          These small churches welcomed newcomers and supported the spiritual, material, and educational needs of residents.

          From as early as 1842 the development of Sunday schools was declared essential “for the benefit of the rising generation and for the edification of its members.” By the time the founders of Mt. Olive were born, their parents had developed Baptist churches and Sunday schools throughout Ontario, organized into two separate Baptist Associations (which eventually unified), and developed schools for Black children (not permitted access to the village schools).

          This headstone north of the town of Kingsville, Ontario recognizes the burial of Black settlers from the Gosfield settlement. Mt. Olive founders William Lyons and his wife Margaret Ryers were from this settlement which was also called Salem or Ryers Corners (after Margaret’s family). The settlement’s only public building appears to have been Shiloh Baptist Church, a small log building which likely served as a school for Black children. Shiloh Baptist had 29 members in 1862. The names of a number of Mt. Olive’s earliest families, such as Greer, Jackson, Jenkins, Jones, Johnson, Lyons, Owens, Ryers, and Saunders appear as families with members buried in the Gosfield Black cemetery. This gravestone marks the site of the settlement graveyard; Shiloh Baptist church closed in the early 20th century and the settlement itself was abandoned shortly afterwards.

          The Gosfield settlement was always very small, just a handful of families, but the Chatham-Kent settlement, Sarah Howard’s hometown, was one of the largest. It was an early settlement, beginning in the 1780s along McGregor's Creek, then known as "The Forks," but by 1850 Black settlers comprised one third of Chatham’s population and had built multiple Black churches, schools, and businesses.

          The First Baptist Church in Chatham began with just nine members in 1843 and congregants built their first building in 1851. 
          In 1856 the three Black Baptist churches in Chatham–First Baptist, Second Baptist and Union Baptist–unified into the First Baptist Congregation of Chatham. The abolitionist John Brown planned his raid on Harpers Ferry in that church in 1858. Although the Black population of Chatham is now very small, First Baptist continues to meet in the same King Street location; its neighborhood remains a significant historical site for Black Canadian history; and The Black Mecca Museum that celebrates Chatham’s Black community lies next door. (This museum and neighborhood is one of several historical sites commemorating Ontario’s Black settlement history.)

          In those settlements and in their churches emerged a strong sense of free Black identity, culture, and mission. After escaping from slavery, their founders nurtured and educated a generation of leaders who would return to Michigan after the War for Black Freedom and take up the work of Black community-building. In 1861 there had been over 1000 members of the Regular Baptist Association in the settlements, and by 1887 that number had dwindled to 368 as young people and entire families moved back into the United States. What their parents had accomplished in the Ontario settlements, the children would do across MIchigan. Baptist men and women from settlements in Ontario developed Baptist churches in Grand Rapids, Kalamazoo, Lansing, Flint, Ypsilanti, Jackson, Adrian, and Ann Arbor. Many of Mt. Olive’s early members came across into Michigan as young adults and built the Southside Black neighborhood in Flint while Billy Durant was still making horse-drawn carriages. The Baptist churches in the settlements always had significant relationships with Baptist churches in Michigan which continued for decades after Emancipation, in part because families lived on both sides of the border.

        <h2>Mt. Olive History</h2>
        <div>
          <p>
          Much has occurred in the decades since. Mt Olive gave birth to many local Baptist churches including St Paul, First Trinity, Grace Emmanuel, Mt Carmel, Christ the Lamb, Mission (Shiloh), and Cornerstone.
          </p>
          <h3>Education</h3>
          <p>
          Mt Olive has had a Sunday School program since its very beginning. Sunday School classes were first organized by Rev. C.E. Lapp from First Baptist Church, Flint and taught by Arthur and Celinda Severance. Classes have been held for children, young adults, adults, men, women, and couples. 
          </p>
          <p>
          Vacation Bible School has been a feature of the educational program in the summer. At times in collaboration with Quinn Chapel.
          </p>
          <p>
          The Ada Berry Bible Class was organized as the Ladies Bible Class in 1924 by Miss Ada Berry, the sister-in-law of Rev. Wade McKinney. Anna Ruth McKinney was the first teacher, followed by many, including Ada Berry, Annie Turpin, Augustus Calloway, Ezra Broadnax, Nellie Kimble, Lois D. Greer, Etta Copedge and Alma Daniels.
          </p>
          <p>
          The presidents of the class have included:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Mrs. George Rankin</li>
            <li>Eletha K. Ray</li>

          </p>
          <h3>Music</h3>
          <p>
          Music too has been a significant feature of Mt Olive since the very beginning. The Senior Choir was organized in 1915 with Willie Perdue as pianist and director, followed by Edith Robinson who served for 29 years. Ruth Buckner succeeded Edith Robinson in 1956, followed by Margaret Anthony. 
          </p>
          <p>
          The youth choir was developed by the Rev and Mrs Turpin in the late 1940s for young people 14 and older. Its first president was Nellie Edwards Raini, its director George Grier, and pianist Emily Calloway. This choir became the Young Adult Choir in the 1950s under the direction of Wade S. Jones with Emily Calloway and Harrison McGee as pianists. Johnnie Wynn Jr. served as president of the Young Adult choir between 1946 and 1958, when Willim Pinnix took over the position through 1965. In 1967 the Young Adult Choir merged with the Senior Choir under its director, Harrison McGee, who became the director, pianist, and organist of what would be renamed in 1993, the Chancel Choir.
          </p>
          <p>
          In 2006 Mt Olive had seven choirs: the Sunshine Choir, the Ambassadors Choir, the Inspirational Choir, the Male Chorus, the Chancel Choir, the Men’s Day Choir, and the Women’s Day Choir.
          </p>
          <h3>Deacon Board</h3>
          <p>
          The deacons of Mt Olive have served as key leaders in Mt. Olive for over a century. They serve the pastor, the church, and those in need. Over the course of their history, they have discussed key aspects of church life, worked with church ministries, advised and supported the pastor, and led and assisted in services. They have conducted the continuous prayer services that honor the anniversaries of the church and they have sponsored missionary initiatives locally and abroad. They support the needs of church members by visiting the sick, preparing Bapstismal candidates, and reaching out to those in need.
          </p>
          <h3>Deaconess and Mothers Board</h3>
          <p>
          The Deaconess Board was organized under Rev. McKinney. Members work in the church to prepare for service and in outreach to members. The board was chaired from 1934-1944 by Ophelia Tallaferio, followed by many others including Susie Suber, Dorris Walton, Montel Sneed, Henrietta French, Rosie Foster, and Versia Wren. The Mothers Board was developed in 1983 as the Deaconess Emeritus Board, and was renamed in 1990.
          </p>
          <h3>Women’s Day</h3>
          <p>
          Rev. Wade McKinney helped organize the first Mt Olive Women’s Day in 1925 to honor the women of the church. The themed women-lead service customarily features guest speakers and a women’s chorus. Speakers have included local, regional, and national dignitaries. Funds raised through Women’s Day events usually support the life of women in the church, for instance remodeling the women’s restrooms. 
          </p>
          <h3>Blue Star Mothers</h3>
          <p>
          During World War II, the Blue Star Mothers at Mt Olive honored mothers whose sons were serving abroad in the armed forces. They wore white dresses with a cap featuring a blue star and raised funds for their work by selling daisies.
          </p>
          <h3>Senior Usher Board</h3>
          <p>
          The Senior Usher Board was formed by Rev. McKinney in 1928 to assist with worship services and Mrs. Annie Turpin organized a Junior Usher Board in 1941.  Members of the senior board have consistently served to support worship and to sponsor significant aspects of building projects.
          </p>
          <h3>The Floral Club</h3>
          <p>
          The Floral Club (named by member Alma Childress) was organized in 1939 for the purpose of beautifying the church and its surroundings and to remember deceased members. The Floral Board's presidents have included Mae Nolan (1939), Lydia Waller (1940), Ella Lewis (1945), Annie Exum (1948), Fannie Ross (1954), Elleanor Holms (1956), Abzee Carter Simmons (1962), and Pauline Todd (1967).
          </p>
          <h3>Birthday Club</h3>
          <p>
          Beginning in 1953, under the leadership of Irene Brown and Alverna Kelly, a Birthday club organized monthly events to recognize birthdays. Local merchants donated cake, punch, and ice cream. In the 1980s those events became quarterly. 
          </p>
          <h3>Theater Groups</h3>
          <p>
          In the 1950s the church organized two short-lived multi-racial theater groups under the direction of Rosa L. Kemp–the Young Adult Players and the Dramusolits. These groups performed plays at the church and in other locations through the city including Central High School and other churches. Two of the plays they performed were <span className="text-italics">Whatsoever Ye Sow</span> and <span className="text-italics">Salvation is Free</span>.
